* MRPTree

MRPTree is C++ library implementing a generalization of the quadtree/octtree concept to any dimension.
This generalization is faster and easier to use than traditional tree based data structures.

When I get some time I start publishing some code; however, right now
this repo only contains some [[https://richmit.github.io/MRPTree/tree_theory/trees.html][documentation]].
