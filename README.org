This repository collects together various notes on the topic of
mathematical function visualization accompanied by practical code
illustrating various techniques.

Most of the programs depend on the
[[https://github.com/richmit/MRPTree][MRPTree]] library -- a C++
library implementing a data structure that is a generalization of the
quadtree/octree concept to any dimension.  As such this repository
also provides a pretty robust set of examples for the
[[https://github.com/richmit/MRPTree][MRPTree]] library.

Some of the code in this repository also makes use of the
[[https://github.com/richmit/MRaster][MRaster]] library for both
image synthesis and color schemes.

In addition to the example code, this repository also provides two
libraries of it's own:
  - A 3D cell complex library (think "triangulation" or "mesh")
  - A library to tessellate [[https://github.com/richmit/MRPTree][MRPTree]] data into a cell complex.
