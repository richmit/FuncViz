
* =MRCellCplx3D= (MR Cell Complex 3D)

[[https://github.com/richmit/MRPTree][=MRPTree=]] is C++ library
implementing a data structure that is a generalization of the
quadtree/octree concept to any dimension.  While
[[https://github.com/richmit/MRPTree][=MRPTree=]] is a pretty general
library, my primary use case for the libray is 2D & 3D visulizations
of mathematical functions.  That's where this library comes into play.
=MRCellCplx3D= is a pretty minimal 3D cell complex library combined
with an adapter to pull data from an
[[https://github.com/richmit/MRPTree][=MRPTree=]] object.
